Narrative:
As a helpful person
I want to provide a story example
So that others can get an idea of the sort of stories I am writing about

Scenario: Checking applications with an examples table
Given an application has an ID of <id>
When I check its state
Then the application should be showing as <normalstate>
And the default action should be <default>
